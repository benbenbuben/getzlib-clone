        "question": "What is Z-Library?",
        "answer": "Z-Library is a shadow library project for file-sharing access to scholarly journal articles, academic texts, and general-interest books. As one of the world's largest online libraries, Z-Library provides access to millions of books and articles."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is Z-Library legal?",
        "answer": "The legal status of Z-Library varies by jurisdiction. While Z-Library operates as a resource for educational materials, many countries have copyright laws that may restrict some of Z-Library's activities. We recommend checking your local laws and regulations before using Z-Library services."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why do Z-Library domains change?",
        "answer": "Z-Library domains change frequently due to various legal challenges and copyright enforcement actions. As a shadow library, Z-Library adapts by changing domain names to maintain service availability. We help track the latest working Z-Library domains."
      },
      {
        "question": "How can I access Z-Library when official domains are blocked?",
        "answer": "When official Z-Library domains are blocked, you can use alternative access methods such as the Z-Library Tor network, Z-Library mirror sites, or Z-Library's personal domains. Our website provides up-to-date information on the latest Z-Library access points."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need an account to use Z-Library?",
        "answer": "While Z-Library allows basic access without registration, creating a free Z-Library account provides benefits such as increased download limits, personal Z-Library domain, and better Z-Library service features. Z-Library also offers premium accounts with additional privileges."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is it safe to use Z-Library?",
        "answer": "Z-Library itself focuses on providing access to books and articles, but as with any online service, users should practice standard internet safety. When accessing Z-Library, use trusted links (like those we verify), avoid suspicious download prompts, and consider using a VPN for additional privacy when visiting Z-Library sites."
      },
      {
        "question": "What's the difference between Z-Library and other digital libraries?",
        "answer": "Z-Library distinguishes itself from other digital libraries by its vast collection size (millions of books and articles), free access model, and resilient infrastructure. Unlike many official digital libraries, Z-Library operates independently of traditional publishing constraints, allowing it to provide broader access to materials."
      },
      {
        "question": "What file formats does Z-Library support?",
        "answer": "Z-Library supports multiple e-book and document formats, including PDF, EPUB, MOBI, AZW, AZW3, FB2, and more. This makes Z-Library compatible with virtually all e-readers, tablets, and computers, providing flexibility for how you access and read Z-Library content."
